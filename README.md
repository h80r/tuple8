This package implements a new approach to Tuples in dart, getting values by type on a getter method.

## Features

- 2-tuple implementation;
- Getting values by type;
- Easy usage without external dependencies;
- Unit-tested code;
- Clear documentation;

## Getting started

Simply add this dependency to your `pubpec.yaml` or use _dart/flutter_ `pub add` CLI.

## Usage

```dart
import 'package:tuple8/tuple.dart';

// [ Unrelated Code ]

  final tuple = Tuple(1, 1.0);
  
// [ Unrelated Code ]
```

## Additional information

Initially I don't plan on expanding this package to cover 3-tuples, 4-tuples... But if there is an interest, I will update and add new features.
